112	
113	#### 2.3. Limitations on Grant Scope
114	
115	The licenses granted in this Section 2 are the only rights granted under
116	this License. No additional rights or licenses will be implied from the
117	distribution or licensing of Covered Software under this License.
118	Notwithstanding Section 2.1(b) above, no patent license is granted by a

132	the notice requirements in Section 3.4).
133	
134	#### 2.4. Subsequent Licenses
135	
136	No Contributor makes additional grants as a result of Your choice to
137	distribute the Covered Software under a subsequent version of this
138	License (see Section 10.2) or under the terms of a Secondary License (if
139	permitted under the terms of Section 3.3).
140	
141	#### 2.5. Representation

146	
147	#### 2.6. Fair Use

152	
153	#### 2.7. Conditions
154	
155	Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4 are conditions of the licenses granted

157	
158	
159	### 3. Responsibilities
160	
161	#### 3.1. Distribution of Source Form
162	
163	All distribution of Covered Software in Source Code Form, including any
164	Modifications that You create or to which You contribute, must be under
165	the terms of this License. You must inform recipients that the Source
166	Code Form of the Covered Software is governed by the terms of this
167	License, and how they can obtain a copy of this License. You may not
168	attempt to alter or restrict the recipients' rights in the Source Code
169	Form.
170	
171	#### 3.2. Distribution of Executable Form
172	
173	If You distribute Covered Software in Executable Form then:
174	
175	* **(a)** such Covered Software must also be made available in Source Code
176	    Form, as described in Section 3.1, and You must inform recipients of
177	    the Executable Form how they can obtain a copy of such Source Code
178	    Form by reasonable means in a timely manner, at a charge no more
179	    than the cost of distribution to the recipient; and
180	
181	* **(b)** You may distribute such Executable Form under the terms of this
182	    License, or sublicense it under different terms, provided that the
183	    license for the Executable Form does not attempt to limit or alter
184	    the recipients' rights in the Source Code Form under this License.
185	
186	#### 3.3. Distribution of a Larger Work
187	
188	You may create and distribute a Larger Work under terms of Your choice,
189	provided that You also comply with the requirements of this License for
190	the Covered Software. If the Larger Work is a combination of Covered
191	Software with a work governed by one or more Secondary Licenses, and the
192	Covered Software is not Incompatible With Secondary Licenses, this
193	License permits You to additionally distribute such Covered Software
194	under the terms of such Secondary License(s), so that the recipient of
195	the Larger Work may, at their option, further distribute the Covered
196	Software under the terms of either this License or such Secondary
197	License(s).
198	
199	#### 3.4. Notices
200	
201	You may not remove or alter the substance of any license notices
202	(including copyright notices, patent notices, disclaimers of warranty,
203	or limitations of liability) contained within the Source Code Form of
204	the Covered Software, except that You may alter any license notices to
205	the extent required to remedy known factual inaccuracies.
206	
207	#### 3.5. Application of Additional Terms
208	
209	You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
210	indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
211	Software. However, You may do so only on Your own behalf, and not on
212	behalf of any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that any
213	such warranty, support, indemnity, or liability obligation is offered by
214	You alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify every Contributor for any
215	liability incurred by such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
216	indemnity or liability terms You offer. You may include additional
217	disclaimers of warranty and limitations of liability specific to any
218	jurisdiction.
219	
220	
221	### 4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation
222	
223	If it is impossible for You to comply with any of the terms of this
224	License with respect to some or all of the Covered Software due to
225	statute, judicial order, or regulation then You must: **(a)** comply with
226	the terms of this License to the maximum extent possible; and **(b)**
227	describe the limitations and the code they affect. Such description must
228	be placed in a text file included with all distributions of the Covered
229	Software under this License. Except to the extent prohibited by statute
230	or regulation, such description must be sufficiently detailed for a
231	recipient of ordinary skill to be able to understand it.
232	
233	
234	### 5. Termination
235	
236	**5.1.** The rights granted under this License will terminate automatically
237	if You fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if You become
238	compliant, then the rights granted under this License from a particular
239	Contributor are reinstated **(a)** provisionally, unless and until such
240	Contributor explicitly and finally terminates Your grants, and **(b)** on an
241	ongoing basis, if such Contributor fails to notify You of the
242	non-compliance by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after You have
243	come back into compliance. Moreover, Your grants from a particular
244	Contributor are reinstated on an ongoing basis if such Contributor
245	notifies You of the non-compliance by some reasonable means, this is the
246	first time You have received notice of non-compliance with this License
247	from such Contributor, and You become compliant prior to 30 days after
248	Your receipt of the notice.
249	
250	**5.2.** If You initiate litigation against any entity by asserting a patent
251	infringement claim (excluding declaratory judgment actions,
252	counter-claims, and cross-claims) alleging that a Contributor Version
253	directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then the rights granted to
254	You by any and all Contributors for the Covered Software under Section
255	2.1 of this License shall terminate.
256	
257	**5.3.** In the event of termination under Sections 5.1 or 5.2 above, all
258	end user license agreements (excluding distributors and resellers) which
259	have been validly granted by You or Your distributors under this License
260	prior to termination shall survive termination.
261	
262	
263	### 6. Disclaimer of Warranty
264	
265	> Covered Software is provided under this License on an “as is”
266	> basis, without warranty of any kind, either expressed, implied, or
267	> statutory, including, without limitation, warranties that the
268	> Covered Software is free of defects, merchantable, fit for a
269	> particular purpose or non-infringing. The entire risk as to the
270	> quality and performance of the Covered Software is with You.
271	> Should any Covered Software prove defective in any respect, You
272	> (not any Contributor) assume the cost of any necessary servicing,
273	> repair, or correction. This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an
274	> essential part of this License. No use of any Covered Software is
275	> authorized under this License except under this disclaimer.
276	
277	### 7. Limitation of Liability
278	
279	> Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
280	> (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any
281	> Contributor, or anyone who distributes Covered Software as
282	> permitted above, be liable to You for any direct, indirect,
283	> special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
284	> including, without limitation, damages for lost profits, loss of
285	> goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any
286	> and all other commercial damages or losses, even if such party
287	> shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages. This
288	> limitation of liability shall not apply to liability for death or
289	> personal injury resulting from such party's negligence to the
290	> extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
291	> jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
292	> incidental or consequential damages, so this exclusion and
293	> limitation may not apply to You.
294	
295	
296	### 8. Litigation
297	
298	Any litigation relating to this License may be brought only in the
299	courts of a jurisdiction where the defendant maintains its principal
300	place of business and such litigation shall be governed by laws of that
301	jurisdiction, without reference to its conflict-of-law provisions.
302	Nothing in this Section shall prevent a party's ability to bring
303	cross-claims or counter-claims.
304	
305	
306	### 9. Miscellaneous
307	
308	This License represents the complete agreement concerning the subject
309	matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
310	unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
311	necessary to make it enforceable. Any law or regulation which provides
312	that the language of a contract shall be construed against the drafter
313	shall not be used to construe this License against a Contributor.
314	
315

331	
332	#### 10.3. Modified Versions

335	create a new license for such software, you may create and use a
336	modified version of this License if you rename the license and remove
337	any references to the name of the license steward (except to note that
338	such modified license differs from this License).
